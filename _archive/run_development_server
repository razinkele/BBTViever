Production Server Issues (Still Unresolved)

  The production server at http://laguna.ku.lt/BBTS still has issues:
  1. ❌ Static files not loading (CSS, JS, images)
  2. ❌ Too many workers (58 instead of ~8)
  3. ❌ 96MB error log file

  The nginx errors show it's looking for files at /usr/share/nginx/html/static/ when they're actually at
  /var/www/marbefes-bbt/static/.

  To access your application now, use the development server:
  http://laguna.ku.lt:5001

  This bypasses all nginx complexity and gives you a fully functional application with all styling and JavaScript
  working correctly!
