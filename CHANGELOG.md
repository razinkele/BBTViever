### Changed
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`
- Version bumped to 1.2.4 in `src/emodnet_viewer/__version__.py`
- Documentation updated across README.md, CLAUDE.md, and version modal

### Technical Details

- Performance metrics flush every 10 entries or on page unload
- Rate limiting: 30 metrics requests per minute per client
- Bundle includes: debug.js, bbt-regions.js, marbefes-datasets.js, config.js, map-init.js, layer-manager.js, bbt-tool.js, ui-handlers.js, app.js

### Files Created
- `build_bundle.py` - JavaScript bundler with dependency ordering
- `package.json` - NPM configuration with Terser minification
- `static/js/utils/performance-monitor.js` - Performance monitoring module
- `static/dist/` - Bundle output directory
- `P1_OPTIMIZATIONS_COMPLETE.md` - Comprehensive optimization report

## [1.2.3] - 2025-10-13

### Added
