# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical session-specific documentation files from the MARBEFES BBT Database development process.

## Purpose

These files document:
- Development sessions and debugging processes
- Incremental fixes and improvements
- Testing reports and deployment procedures
- Code review and optimization sessions
- Version-specific deployment instructions

## Organization

Files are preserved for historical reference and audit trails, but are no longer actively maintained. For current documentation, see the project root:

### Active Documentation (in project root)
- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant context and project instructions
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and release notes
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Current production deployment guide
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Developer setup and contribution guide
- **COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md** - Latest full application audit

### Archived Content (70 files)

**Categories:**
- **Fixes & Improvements:** 25+ files documenting specific bug fixes and enhancements

## File Naming Patterns

- `*_FIX*.md` - Bug fixes and solutions
- `*DEPLOY*.md` - Deployment procedures
- `*TEST*.md` - Testing reports
- `*OPTIMIZATION*.md` - Performance improvements
- `*_SUMMARY.md` - Session summaries
- `*_v1.2.*.md` - Version-specific documentation

## When to Reference

These archived files are useful when:
1. Understanding the evolution of a specific feature
2. Debugging a regression by reviewing historical fixes
3. Conducting code archaeology for design decisions
4. Preparing comprehensive project retrospectives

## Maintenance Policy

- ✅ Files are preserved as-is (no updates)
- ✅ Read-only reference material
- ✅ Indexed by git for searchability
- ❌ Not linked from main documentation
