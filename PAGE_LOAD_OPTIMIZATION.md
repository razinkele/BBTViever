# Page Load Time Optimization - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem
Application was taking **3+ minutes** to load the main page.

## Root Cause Analysis
The index route (`/`) synchronously fetches data from two external WMS services:
1. **EMODnet WMS** - https://ows.emodnet-seabedhabitats.eu (seabed habitat data)
2. **HELCOM WMS** - https://maps.helcom.fi (Baltic Sea pressures data)

Original configuration:
- WMS_TIMEOUT: 10 seconds
- max_retries: 3 (in HTTP adapter)
- **Total wait time**: (10s timeout × 3 retries) × 2 services = **60+ seconds**

When external services are slow or unresponsive, the retries multiply the delay.

## Optimization Applied

### Change 1: Reduced HTTP Retries
**File:** `app.py:62`
```python
# BEFORE:
max_retries=3,        # Retry failed requests

# AFTER:
max_retries=0,        # No retries for faster page loads
```

### Change 2: Set Optimal Timeout
**Environment variable:** `WMS_TIMEOUT=5`
- Reduced from 10s to 5s
- Fast enough for responsive services
- Quick enough to fail over to fallback data

## Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Page Load Time | 180+ seconds | ~7 seconds | **96% faster** |
| EMODnet Fetch | 30s (with retries) | 5s (timeout, uses fallback) | 83% faster |
| HELCOM Fetch | 30s+ | 2s (success) | 93% faster |
| User Experience | Unusable | Acceptable | ✅ |

## Timing Breakdown (Current)
```
00:07:04 - Start EMODnet fetch
00:07:09 - EMODnet timeout (5s) → uses fallback layers
00:07:09 - Start HELCOM fetch
00:07:11 - HELCOM success (2s) → 218 layers loaded
00:07:11 - Page rendered
```

**Total:** ~7 seconds

## Trade-offs
- **Pro:** Much faster page loads (96% improvement)
- **Pro:** Falls back to hardcoded EMODnet layers (still functional)
- **Pro:** HELCOM data still loads successfully
- **Con:** No automatic retry on temporary network glitches
- **Mitigation:** Browser refresh retries the request if needed

## Configuration
To start the optimized server:
```bash
WMS_TIMEOUT=5 python3 app.py
```

Or set permanently in environment:
```bash
export WMS_TIMEOUT=5
python3 app.py
```

## Status
**COMPLETE** - Server now loads in ~7 seconds instead of 3+ minutes.
